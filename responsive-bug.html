This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with complex responsive design setups.  It manifests as styles not applying correctly or unexpectedly, particularly when using multiple responsive modifiers like `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, etc., in combination with other directives. This is often due to conflicting or overlapping styles that the compiler doesn't properly resolve. For example, applying conflicting margin, padding or width values across different breakpoints can lead to unexpected visual behavior. The issue might not show up immediately; it might only appear on certain screen sizes.
