The solution involves careful organization and prioritization of your styles. Here are a few approaches:

1. **Specificity:** Ensure your styles are specific enough to override conflicting styles.  Use more specific selectors, like class names or descendant selectors, where necessary.
2. **Style Ordering:**  Pay close attention to the order of your styles. Later styles in the CSS file will override earlier ones with lower specificity.
3. **Responsive Utility Classes:**  Use Tailwind's built-in responsive modifiers efficiently. Avoid redundancy or conflicting modifiers. 
4. **@layer:**  Employ Tailwind's `@layer` directive to separate and organize your styles into different layers, allowing for better control of precedence. 
5. **Debugging:** Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the element's computed styles and identify the source of the conflict. 

The `responsive-solution.html` file demonstrates these solutions by restructuring the CSS and applying appropriate specificity to resolve the conflict.
